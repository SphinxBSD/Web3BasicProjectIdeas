# 9. ERC1155 Bingo

Use ERC1155 tokens to simulate a deck of cards that can take on any value from 1-25 inclusive. Each player starts with a 5×5 2D array of the numbers 1-25 randomly arranged. Every n blocks, players can mint a new card which has a random number. Whoever gets the first 5 in a row (bingo) wins.
